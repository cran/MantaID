#' Data balance.
#' Most classes adopt random undersampling, while a few classes adopt smote method to oversample to obtain relatively balanced data.
#' @param data A data frame. Except for class column, all are numeric types.
#' @param ratio Numeric between 0 and 1. The percent of the test set split from data.
#' @param parallel Logical.
#' @return A list contains a train set and a test set.
